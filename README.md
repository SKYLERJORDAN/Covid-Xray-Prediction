# COVID-19 X-Ray Classification CNN

## Pneumonia Detection on COVID-19 Chest X-Rays using CNN

### Project Overview
This repository contains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch using PyTorch for detecting pneumonia in COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The model achieves **97.50% accuracy** on the test dataset, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the architecture and my understanding of deep learning fundamentals.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture implemented in this project consists of:
- **4 convolutional layers** with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128, 256)
- **Max pooling layers** after each convolution for dimensionality reduction
- **ReLU activation functions** to introduce non-linearity
- **Two fully connected layers** (512 neurons in the hidden layer)
- **Output layer** for classification

## Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated on a held-out test set with impressive results:
- **Accuracy**: 97.50%
- **Precision**: 97.62%
- **Recall**: 97.50%
- **F1 Score**: 97.50%

## Implementation Details
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Training**: 8 epochs with Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.001)
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Input Processing**: Images resized to 256Ã—256 and normalized
- **Data Augmentation**: Basic transformations applied to improve model generalization
